# codeQuiz WIP

## Description:
    A code quiz application, the user clicks buttons to answer questions. A time penalty occurs if the user answers incorrectly, and the user's score increases if they answer correctly
    At the end of the quiz, the scores of recent attempts are displayed with the names of the users

## Intended Functionality:
    The user clicks on the Begin Quiz button and the HTML elements that display the quiz are displayed and filled with text from objects in an array of questions. When the user clicks the right answer, their score increases, but they are not notified. When the user selects incorrectly, a time penalty occurs, which compounds if they continue to answer incorrectly

## Current Issues:
    The end screen with the scores does not appear (is not coded yet), and the part of the application that takes in the user's name and stores it with the score in localStorage is not functional
